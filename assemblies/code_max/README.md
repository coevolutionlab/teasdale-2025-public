This is an archive of code from a early participant in this project who generated the original genomes. These are here for posterity's sake alone, DO NOT base your analyses on these as there better approaches 4 years later.

Please also note that this code archive contains some code for annotation. This was used to generate the initial computational annotations that we decided were insufficient, before we obtained ISOseq evidence. Again this is only for posterity's sake; all annotations released with this paper were made with code in /annotation from the root of this repository.
