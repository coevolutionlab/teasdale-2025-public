## Taxonomy TEs

We used TEsorter to taxonomically classify each one of the TE models used in
the pipeline. Helitrons however, are prone to capture other TE domains, and
are often misclassified because of it. Thus, we will exclude them from the
classification.

We first fix the Unassigned superfamily category present in TAIR10, as some
Unassigned actually  have a known classification.
Sadhu family from Unassigned to SINE.

WARNING!

The final taxonomy_classification.tsv  and related code is not as stable as
the rest. Be careful to use it as it is.
