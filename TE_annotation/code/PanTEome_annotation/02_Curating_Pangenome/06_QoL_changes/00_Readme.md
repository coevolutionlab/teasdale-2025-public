This is the last step of the curation, here we simply cleanup some of the
TE terminology between tools, we add the length of the TE, we cleanup the
family names of the TAIR10 homologs  we renamed the  chromosomes and we

We also tackle the new corrected version of at9879 assembly that presented
and inversion in the chromosome 2. To map the old annotation to the new
assembly, we used liftoff.
