## 01 Tandem repeats Curation

We noticed a high levels of miss annotation in tandem repeats (specially at
centromeres and telomeres). Annotated TEs that fall  > 80% in TRF tandem repeats
are removed. We also Manually inspected the TE model ATREP18, which is a source
of erroneous annotations due containing  canonical satellite repeats in its
model.
